Model building :
Steps involved in the process of building a model include establishing methods for data collection, 
comprehending and paying attention to what is significant in the data in order to answer the questions that 
you are posing, and creating a statistical, mathematical, or simulation model in order to acquire 
understanding and make predictions.
Here the developer will use the LSTM model with the model layer of 50 neurons and the relu activation 
function. With the help of keras.model the developer will install the sequential model, as for the activation 
function the developer will be using adam , Dense, LSTM, LeakyReLU,Dropout are the layers imported 
from Kears library. 
The number of units which the number neurons are set as 64, the learning rate is set as 0.0001, the activation 
function as sigmoid and loss function as mse (mean-squared error), the batch size as 5 and the number of 
epochs as 250.
